Ideas Practiced:
  -data attributes
    data keys
    keycode.info (keys on keyboard & associated numerical value)
  -eventListeners
    keydown events
    transitionend events
  -playing audio
  
  Struggles:
  ES6 syntax - it's still new and harder to read than the out-of-date JS I have been working with
    data selection syntax for JS (see "const audio" or "const key" as ex)
    forEach structure (with "=>")

  Purpose:
    -practice JS
    -learn ES6 syntax and work with it more
    -make an interesting but simple interactice webpage with new concepts
